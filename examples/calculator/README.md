# Calculator Example - Desktop Application

This is a reference implementation showing how the Claude Code Automation Framework can build a complete desktop application from PRD to deployment.

## What This Example Demonstrates

### Framework Usage
- **Systematic PRD Creation**: Complete requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Task Management**: TodoWrite integration for tracking development progress  
- **Code Quality**: Professional code organization with proper error handling
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test suite with automated reporting
- **Documentation**: Complete user and developer documentation

### Technical Implementation
- **Desktop GUI**: PyQt6 application with professional UI design
- **Real-time Calculation**: Live expression evaluation as you type
- **State Management**: In-memory history with 10-item limit
- **Input Validation**: Safe expression parsing and error handling  
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core logic and UI functionality

## Key Framework Patterns

### 1. PRD-Driven Development
The PRD.md file demonstrates:
- Clear problem statement and solution
- Specific user stories with benefits
- Testable functional requirements
- Explicit non-goals for scope control
- Success metrics and technical considerations

### 2. Systematic Implementation
Development followed framework phases:
- Requirements → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
- TodoWrite task management throughout
- Regular validation against PRD requirements

### 3. Quality Standards
Code demonstrates framework standards:
- Clean, self-documenting code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and security
- Professional UI/UX design
- Maintainable architecture

### 4. Testing Strategy
Multi-level testing approach:
- Unit tests for calculation engine
- Integration tests for UI components
- Automated test runner with timestamped reports
- 100% requirement coverage validation

## Running the Example

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd framework/examples/calculator/deliverables
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the calculator**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   python test/run_tests.py
   ```

## Learning from This Example

This calculator example shows how the framework enables:

1. **Rapid Development**: From idea to working application in systematic phases
2. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation processes
3. **Professional Results**: Production-ready code with proper architecture
4. **Maintainability**: Clear structure that's easy to understand and modify
5. **Scalability**: Patterns that work for simple tools and complex applications

The same framework patterns used here scale up to build web applications, APIs, ML systems, and trading dashboards while maintaining the same quality standards and systematic approach.
