# Calculator App - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview

**Problem Statement:** Users need a simple, professional-looking desktop calculator that provides real-time calculation feedback and the ability to save/recall previous calculations. Current basic calculators lack visual feedback during input and don't provide calculation history management.

**Solution Summary:** A Python desktop calculator application for macOS that supports infix notation with parentheses, real-time calculation display, and a save/recall system for calculation history.

**Primary Goal:** Create an intuitive, visually appealing calculator that performs accurate calculations with immediate feedback and convenient history management.

## 2. Goals

1. **Accuracy**: All calculations must be mathematically correct with up to 8 decimal places precision
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Display calculation results immediately as users type valid expressions
3. **User Experience**: Provide clean, professional UI with intuitive layout matching iPhone calculator design
4. **History Management**: Enable users to save and recall up to 10 previous calculations efficiently
5. **Input Flexibility**: Support both keyboard and mouse input with full expression editing capabilities

## 3. User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to enter mathematical expressions using keyboard or buttons so that I can perform calculations efficiently
2. **As a user**, I want to see calculation results in real-time so that I can verify my input as I type
3. **As a user**, I want to edit my expressions using arrow keys so that I can correct mistakes without retyping
4. **As a user**, I want to use parentheses for complex calculations so that I can control operation precedence
5. **As a user**, I want to save frequently used calculations so that I can reuse them later
6. **As a user**, I want to recall saved calculations from a dropdown so that I can quickly access my calculation history
7. **As a user**, I want clear error indicators so that I understand when my input is invalid
8. **As a user**, I want a professional, clean interface so that the app feels polished and trustworthy

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. **The system must** provide a 60-character wide input window with left-aligned cursor and right-aligned equals sign
2. **The system must** support infix notation with operators +, -, *, /, decimal points, and parentheses
3. **The system must** calculate and display results in real-time as valid expressions are entered
4. **The system must** display "?" when the left-hand side contains invalid expressions
5. **The system must** display "Too Small" when calculation results are too small to represent in 8 decimal places
6. **The system must** limit decimal precision to maximum 8 places without scientific notation
7. **The system must** prevent input of invalid characters (only allow 0-9, +, -, *, /, ., (, ))
8. **The system must** support full text editing with left/right arrow keys and delete functionality
9. **The system must** provide Clear button that resets to initial state with equals sign
10. **The system must** provide Save button that stores current expression and result to history stack
11. **The system must** maintain maximum 10 saved calculations, removing oldest when limit exceeded
12. **The system must** provide Recall button with dropdown showing all saved calculations
13. **The system must** populate input window with selected recalled calculation
14. **The system must** arrange buttons in iPhone calculator layout with additional Save/Recall buttons
15. **The system must** use distinct background colors for numeric, operator, and function buttons
16. **The system must** support both keyboard and mouse input for all operations
17. **The system must** trigger calculation on every character input
18. **The system must** have fixed window size appropriate for 60-character input display

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, etc.)
- Variable storage or programming capabilities
- Export/import of calculation history
- Multiple calculator windows or tabs
- Window resizing functionality
- Support for other operating systems (Windows, Linux)
- Network connectivity or cloud synchronization
- Print functionality
- Copy/paste of individual results (beyond standard text selection)

## 6. Design Considerations

**UI Layout:**
- Input window positioned at top of application
- Button layout matching iPhone calculator (4x5 grid plus Save/Recall)
- Fixed window size, non-resizable
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with professional appearance

**Color Scheme:**
- Numeric buttons: Light background color
- Operator buttons: Medium/accent background color  
- Function buttons (Save, Clear, Recall): Distinct background color
- Consistent text contrast for readability

**Typography:**
- Monospace font for input window to ensure proper character alignment
- Clear, readable font sizes throughout interface

## 7. Technical Considerations

**Platform:** macOS desktop application using Python
**UI Framework:** PyQt or PySide recommended for superior visual appearance over Tkinter
**Architecture:** Single-window application with event-driven input handling
**Expression Parsing:** Implement safe expression evaluation with error handling
**Data Storage:** In-memory storage for calculation history (no persistent storage required)
**Error Handling:** Graceful handling of division by zero, invalid expressions, and overflow conditions

## 8. Success Metrics

**Functional Success:**
- 100% accuracy for all supported mathematical operations
- Zero crashes or unhandled exceptions during normal operation
- All UI elements function as specified (buttons, keyboard input, editing)

**User Experience Success:**
- Real-time calculation feedback with < 100ms response time
- Intuitive operation requiring no user manual or training
- Professional visual appearance comparable to system calculator apps

**Performance Success:**
- Application startup time < 2 seconds
- Calculation response time < 100ms for standard expressions
- Memory usage remains stable during extended use

## 9. Requirements Clarifications

1. **Persistent Storage**: Application must save and remember calculation history between sessions
2. **Accessibility**: No specific accessibility requirements for keyboard navigation or screen readers  
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: No keyboard shortcuts needed for Save and Recall functions
4. **Invalid Expression Saving**: Save whatever is currently in the input window, regardless of validity
5. **Decimal Point Behavior**: Follow standard calculator conventions (automatic leading zero, etc.)
